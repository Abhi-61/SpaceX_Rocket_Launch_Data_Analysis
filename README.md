# SpaceX Rocket Launch Data Analytics
## Introduction and Background
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each,
much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Executive Summary
The following project aims to delve deeper into SpaceX's most successful flight model yet, the Falcon9 and tries to answer the question of whether a successful SpaceX mission can be predicted given the other features of the mission
such as the Booster Versions, Launch Sites, Payload Mass etc.
The project includes an extensive variety of data collection methods using Web Scraping and the SpaceX API.
The dataset is primarily handled through Pandas' Dataframes and visualized through Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Furthermore, Scikit-Learn's Machine Learning libraries are used for predictive analysis, in which multiple predictors are
compared against each other for accuracy.
Finally, the project is concluded with a presentation detailing the findings of the study.
